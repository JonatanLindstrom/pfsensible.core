release_summary: |-
  This is a major refactoring of the ``pfsensible.core`` collection.  The goal
  was to support easier creation of new modules via the ``pfsensible-generate-module``
  script. PFSenseModuleBase was expanded to handle more common functions via
  configuration options and callback functions.
breaking_changes:
  - This release is only expected to work with pfSense 2.8.0+ / pfSense Plus 24.11+ due to changes in various lookup_*() functions in pfSense.
